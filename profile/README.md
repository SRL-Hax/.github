# SRL Hax Archive
The SRL Hax Archive is a side project by me (kirakira) which I shall always try to maintain. It contains mods that have been taken down, mods that are hard to find a working copy of (believe me, I've been through that before), and mods that may be taken down in the future. It also serves as a Archive, archiving different versions of the mod menu that may not be available on Gamebanana pages because they have been replaced. It can serve as a All-In-One package for your Splatooon (intended o) modding journey. Whether its the ancient 1, [adj here] 2, or splatastic 3, this organization has it all (probably).
### [!] Important
SRL Hax Archive is sometimes a heap to handle, and I have a life, so sometimes new releases may not be uploaded for some time, if so pleases be patient. **See below for how to contribute**  

If you would like to be a organization member and have access to directly compile new releases and mods, email me here: kirakirasplat@163.com  
Note that as I am in China (GMT+8:00), it may be some time before I reply as I primarily use WeChat, and obviously %99 of people reading this don't use that so just email me.
### [!] How to Contribute
If you would like to help me out, usually if I haven't released the newest version of the mod yet it means that I may be inactive for a peroid of time, so if you would like to help with a release, create a PR in that repo.  
NOTE: I seriously need someone who knows HTML, I'm very trash at it and I don't trust myself doing it, any help would be welcomed right now :).
